deadlock/livelock - треба упорядковувати доступ до ресурсів брати ресурси лише в певному порядку
see deadlock and livelock examples
also can be fixed if use timeouts in concurrency

raceCondition/dataRace - few thread trying to increase some unsyncronized variable and all receive 10 but should 10,11,12...
dataRace is subcase of raceCondition when thread takes deprecated data that was already changed by another thread
see synchronization and parallelVsConcurrent examples

volitility - some code instructions that read from RAM memory often can be saved in processor local cache to increase speed
it leads to the situation when another process(thread) executing on different processor core2 changing in RAM variables
that are copied into processor local cache of processor core1 and then for some time core1 is working with deprecated data

asynchrony vs parallel vs concurrency
asynchrony - run task in another thread and forget about it or do something else while waiting for the result
parallel - two threads do different tasks or divide one task into few tasks and
